JVM ( Java Virtual Machine )
***
After compilation Byte code (.class file) is generated.
which is  passed to JVM.
There are some components in JVM.
                ---------------------------------------------
                JVM = ClassLoader + Memory + Execution Engine
                ----------------------------------------------

1. ClassLoader --> used to load the .class file into the memory
    a. Bootstrap ClassLoader
    b. Extension ClassLoader
    c. System/App ClassLoader
2. Memory
    a. Class(Method) Area --> used to store the class structure
    b. Heap Area --> used to store the Object
    c. Stack Area --> used to store local variable. It is created each time when method is
    invoked and destroy when method invocation completes.
    d. Program Counter Register --> stores the address of Jvm instruction being executed.
    e. Native Method Stack --> contains all native code used in application.
3. Execution Engine
        a. Interpreter --> It reads the code line by line.
        b. JIT  -->  It means Just-in-Time Compiler. It convert byte code into machine code.
        It improves the Java program performance.
