Features of Java
*****************

Object-oriented
Java is an object-oriented programming language. Everything in Java is an object.

Platform Independent
Java is a write once, run anywhere language. A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a program runs.

Robust
Robust means strong. Java is robust because:
It uses strong memory management.
There is a lack of pointers that avoids security problems.
Java provides automatic garbage collection which runs on the Java Virtual Machine to get rid of objects which are not being used by a Java application anymore.
There are exception handling and the type checking mechanism in Java. All these points make Java robust.

Portable
Java is portable because it facilitates you to carry the Java bytecode to any platform. It doesn't require any implementation.

Multi-threaded
A thread is like a separate program, executing concurrently. We can write Java programs that deal with many tasks at once by defining multiple threads. The main advantage of multi-threading is that it doesn't occupy memory for each thread. It shares a common memory area. Threads are important for multi-media, Web applications, etc.

Secured
Java is best known for its security. With Java, we can develop virus-free systems. Java is secured because:
No explicit pointer
Java Programs run inside a virtual machine sandbox
